# 🎬 FilmFolio – Movie Discovery App

FilmFolio is a sleek and simple web application that lets you discover trending movies and search for your favorites using **The Movie Database (TMDb)** API. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it provides a clean user interface to explore movie titles along with their ratings and descriptions.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔍 Search for any movie by title
- 🟢🟠🔴 Color-coded rating system (Green = Great, Orange = Average, Red = Poor)
- 🎞 Hover to reveal movie overview/description
- 🎨 Responsive and modern UI with attractive design

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 📁 Project Structure
├── index.html # Main HTML structure
├── style.css # All styling using CSS
└── script.js # JavaScript for API calls and DOM manipulation


## 🔧 Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox)
- JavaScript (ES6)
- TMDb API for real-time movie data

## 🛠 How It Works
1. On load, it fetches popular movies from TMDb.
2. Renders each movie as a card with poster, title, rating, and hidden overview.
3. Hovering over a movie reveals its description.
4. The search bar lets users look for specific movie titles using TMDb's search API.

## 🔑 API Key
This project uses a public TMDb API key for educational/demo purposes. If you're forking or cloning this repo for production use:
1. Visit https://www.themoviedb.org
2. Create an account and get your API key
3. Replace the existing key in `script.js`:
```javascript
const API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here';
